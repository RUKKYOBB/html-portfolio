<h1>Best Anime according to Rukky Kay</h1>
<h2>My top three Animes of all time</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Naruto</h3>
<p>This anime contains alot of action and teaches about importants of friends and detremination and not giving up</p>
<h3>Black Clover</h3>
<p>Just like naruto, black clover has the same story line but more magic than naruto</p>
<h3>Nanatsu no Taiza</h3>
<p>AKA The seven deadly sin, this anime is packed with action and debuts the importance of team work and loyalty and an ancient love story between an angel and a demon lord</p>
